# Creating a Smart Album for the Photo Slideshow

## Manual Steps to Create "photoframe" Smart Album:

1. **Open Photos app**
2. **Create Smart Album**:
   - Go to **File → New Smart Album**
   - Name it: `photoframe`
3. **Set Criteria** (choose one or combine):
   - **Recent photos**: Date is in the last 1 year
   - **Favorites**: Photo is favorited
   - **Keywords**: Photo has keyword "slideshow" or "frame"
   - **Rating**: Photo has rating ≥ 3 stars
4. **Click OK** to create the Smart Album

## Benefits of Smart Album:
- **Dynamic**: Automatically updates as you add/remove photos
- **Criteria-based**: Uses rules instead of manual photo selection
- **Flexible**: Can combine multiple conditions

## Example Smart Album Criteria:
```
Date is in the last 2 years
AND
(Photo is favorited OR Rating is ≥ 3 stars)
```

This will automatically include your best recent photos in the slideshow!
